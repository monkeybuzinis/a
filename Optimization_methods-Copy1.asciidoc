== Optimization Methods

Until now, you’ve always used Gradient Descent to update the parameters
and minimize the cost. In this notebook, you’ll gain skills with some
more advanced optimization methods that can speed up learning and
perhaps even get you to a better final value for the cost function.
Having a good optimization algorithm can be the difference between
waiting days vs. just a few hours to get a good result.

By the end of this notebook, you’ll be able to:

* Apply optimization methods such as (Stochastic) Gradient Descent,
Momentum, RMSProp and Adam
* Use random minibatches to accelerate convergence and improve
optimization

Gradient descent goes ``downhill'' on a cost function latexmath:[$J$].
Think of it as trying to do this:

Figure 1 : Minimizing the cost is like finding the lowest point in a
hilly landscape At each step of the training, you update your parameters
following a certain direction to try to get to the lowest possible
point.

*Notations*: As usual, $ = $ `da` for any variable `a`.

Let’s get started!

## 2 - Gradient Descent

A simple optimization method in machine learning is gradient descent
(GD). When you take gradient steps with respect to all latexmath:[$m$]
examples on each step, it is also called Batch Gradient Descent.

### Exercise 1 - update_parameters_with_gd

Implement the gradient descent update rule. The gradient descent rule
is, for latexmath:[$l = 1, ..., L$]:

[latexmath]
++++
\[ W^{[l]} = W^{[l]} - \alpha \text{ } dW^{[l]} \tag{1}\]
++++

[latexmath]
++++
\[ b^{[l]} = b^{[l]} - \alpha \text{ } db^{[l]} \tag{2}\]
++++

where L is the number of layers and latexmath:[$\alpha$] is the learning
rate. All parameters should be stored in the `parameters` dictionary.
Note that the iterator `l` starts at 1 in the `for` loop as the first
parameters are latexmath:[$W^{[1]}$] and latexmath:[$b^{[1]}$].

A variant of this is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which is
equivalent to mini-batch gradient descent, where each mini-batch has
just 1 example. The update rule that you have just implemented does not
change. What changes is that you would be computing gradients on just
one training example at a time, rather than on the whole training set.
The code examples below illustrate the difference between stochastic
gradient descent and (batch) gradient descent.

* *(Batch) Gradient Descent*:

[source,python]
----
X = data_input
Y = labels
m = X.shape[1]  # Number of training examples
parameters = initialize_parameters(layers_dims)
for i in range(0, num_iterations):
    # Forward propagation
    a, caches = forward_propagation(X, parameters)
    # Compute cost
    cost_total = compute_cost(a, Y)  # Cost for m training examples
    # Backward propagation
    grads = backward_propagation(a, caches, parameters)
    # Update parameters
    parameters = update_parameters(parameters, grads)
    # Compute average cost
    cost_avg = cost_total / m
        
----

* *Stochastic Gradient Descent*:

[source,python]
----
X = data_input
Y = labels
m = X.shape[1]  # Number of training examples
parameters = initialize_parameters(layers_dims)
for i in range(0, num_iterations):
    cost_total = 0
    for j in range(0, m):
        # Forward propagation
        a, caches = forward_propagation(X[:,j], parameters)
        # Compute cost
        cost_total += compute_cost(a, Y[:,j])  # Cost for one training example
        # Backward propagation
        grads = backward_propagation(a, caches, parameters)
        # Update parameters
        parameters = update_parameters(parameters, grads)
    # Compute average cost
    cost_avg = cost_total / m
----

In Stochastic Gradient Descent, you use only 1 training example before
updating the gradients. When the training set is large, SGD can be
faster. But the parameters will ``oscillate'' toward the minimum rather
than converge smoothly. Here’s what that looks like:

Figure 1 : SGD vs GD ``+'' denotes a minimum of the cost. SGD leads to
many oscillations to reach convergence, but each step is a lot faster to
compute for SGD than it is for GD, as it uses only one training example
(vs. the whole batch for GD).

*Note* also that implementing SGD requires 3 for-loops in total: 1. Over
the number of iterations 2. Over the latexmath:[$m$] training examples
3. Over the layers (to update all parameters, from
latexmath:[$(W^{[1]},b^{[1]})$] to latexmath:[$(W^{[L]},b^{[L]})$])

In practice, you’ll often get faster results if you don’t use the entire
training set, or just one training example, to perform each update.
Mini-batch gradient descent uses an intermediate number of examples for
each step. With mini-batch gradient descent, you loop over the
mini-batches instead of looping over individual training examples.

Figure 2 : SGD vs Mini-Batch GD ``+'' denotes a minimum of the cost.
Using mini-batches in your optimization algorithm often leads to faster
optimization.

## 3 - Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

Now you’ll build some mini-batches from the training set (X, Y).

There are two steps: - *Shuffle*: Create a shuffled version of the
training set (X, Y) as shown below. Each column of X and Y represents a
training example. Note that the random shuffling is done synchronously
between X and Y. Such that after the shuffling the latexmath:[$i^{th}$]
column of X is the example corresponding to the latexmath:[$i^{th}$]
label in Y. The shuffling step ensures that examples will be split
randomly into different mini-batches.

* *Partition*: Partition the shuffled (X, Y) into mini-batches of size
`mini_batch_size` (here 64). Note that the number of training examples
is not always divisible by `mini_batch_size`. The last mini batch might
be smaller, but you don’t need to worry about this. When the final
mini-batch is smaller than the full `mini_batch_size`, it will look like
this:

### Exercise 2 - random_mini_batches

Implement `random_mini_batches`. The shuffling part has already been
coded for you! To help with the partitioning step, you’ve been provided
the following code that selects the indexes for the latexmath:[$1^{st}$]
and latexmath:[$2^{nd}$] mini-batches:

[source,python]
----
first_mini_batch_X = shuffled_X[:, 0 : mini_batch_size]
second_mini_batch_X = shuffled_X[:, mini_batch_size : 2 * mini_batch_size]
...
----

Note that the last mini-batch might end up smaller than
`mini_batch_size=64`. Let latexmath:[$\lfloor s \rfloor$] represents
latexmath:[$s$] rounded down to the nearest integer (this is
`math.floor(s)` in Python). If the total number of examples is not a
multiple of `mini_batch_size=64` then there will be
latexmath:[$\left\lfloor \frac{m}{mini\_batch\_size}\right\rfloor$]
mini-batches with a full 64 examples, and the number of examples in the
final mini-batch will be
latexmath:[$\left(m-mini_\_batch_\_size \times \left\lfloor \frac{m}{mini\_batch\_size}\right\rfloor\right)$].

*Hint:*

[latexmath]
++++
\[mini\_batch\_X = shuffled\_X[:, i : j]\]
++++

Think of a way in which you can use the for loop variable `k` help you
increment `i` and `j` in multiples of mini_batch_size.

As an example, if you want to increment in multiples of 3, you could the
following:

[source,python]
----
n = 3
for k in (0 , 5):
    print(k * n)

*What you should remember*: - Shuffling and Partitioning are the two
steps required to build mini-batches - Powers of two are often chosen to
be the mini-batch size, e.g., 16, 32, 64, 128.

## 4 - Momentum

Because mini-batch gradient descent makes a parameter update after
seeing just a subset of examples, the direction of the update has some
variance, and so the path taken by mini-batch gradient descent will
``oscillate'' toward convergence. Using momentum can reduce these
oscillations.

Momentum takes into account the past gradients to smooth out the update.
The `direction' of the previous gradients is stored in the variable
latexmath:[$v$]. Formally, this will be the exponentially weighted
average of the gradient on previous steps. You can also think of
latexmath:[$v$] as the ``velocity'' of a ball rolling downhill, building
up speed (and momentum) according to the direction of the gradient/slope
of the hill.

Figure 3 : The red arrows show the direction taken by one step of
mini-batch gradient descent with momentum. The blue points show the
direction of the gradient (with respect to the current mini-batch) on
each step. Rather than just following the gradient, the gradient is
allowed to influence latexmath:[$v$] and then take a step in the
direction of latexmath:[$v$].

 +
### Exercise 3 - initialize_velocity Initialize the velocity. The
velocity, latexmath:[$v$], is a python dictionary that needs to be
initialized with arrays of zeros. Its keys are the same as those in the
`grads` dictionary, that is: for latexmath:[$l =1,...,L$]:

[source,python]
----
v["dW" + str(l)] = ... #(numpy array of zeros with the same shape as parameters["W" + str(l)])
v["db" + str(l)] = ... #(numpy array of zeros with the same shape as parameters["b" + str(l)])
----

*Note* that the iterator l starts at 1 in the for loop as the first
parameters are v[``dW1''] and v[``db1''] (that’s a ``one'' on the
superscript).

### Exercise 4 - update_parameters_with_momentum

Now, implement the parameters update with momentum. The momentum update
rule is, for latexmath:[$l = 1, ..., L$]:

[latexmath]
++++
\[ \begin{cases}
v_{dW^{[l]}} = \beta v_{dW^{[l]}} + (1 - \beta) dW^{[l]} \\
W^{[l]} = W^{[l]} - \alpha v_{dW^{[l]}}
\end{cases}\tag{3}\]
++++

[latexmath]
++++
\[\begin{cases}
v_{db^{[l]}} = \beta v_{db^{[l]}} + (1 - \beta) db^{[l]} \\
b^{[l]} = b^{[l]} - \alpha v_{db^{[l]}} 
\end{cases}\tag{4}\]
++++

where L is the number of layers, latexmath:[$\beta$] is the momentum and
latexmath:[$\alpha$] is the learning rate. All parameters should be
stored in the `parameters` dictionary. Note that the iterator `l` starts
at 1 in the `for` loop as the first parameters are latexmath:[$W^{[1]}$]
and latexmath:[$b^{[1]}$] (that’s a ``one'' on the superscript).

*Note that*: - The velocity is initialized with zeros. So the algorithm
will take a few iterations to ``build up'' velocity and start to take
bigger steps. - If latexmath:[$\beta = 0$], then this just becomes
standard gradient descent without momentum.

*How do you choose latexmath:[$\beta$]?*

* The larger the momentum latexmath:[$\beta$] is, the smoother the
update, because it takes the past gradients into account more. But if
latexmath:[$\beta$] is too big, it could also smooth out the updates too
much.
* Common values for latexmath:[$\beta$] range from 0.8 to 0.999. If you
don’t feel inclined to tune this, latexmath:[$\beta = 0.9$] is often a
reasonable default.
* Tuning the optimal latexmath:[$\beta$] for your model might require
trying several values to see what works best in terms of reducing the
value of the cost function latexmath:[$J$].

*What you should remember*: - Momentum takes past gradients into account
to smooth out the steps of gradient descent. It can be applied with
batch gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent or stochastic
gradient descent. - You have to tune a momentum hyperparameter
latexmath:[$\beta$] and a learning rate latexmath:[$\alpha$].

## 5 - Adam

Adam is one of the most effective optimization algorithms for training
neural networks. It combines ideas from RMSProp (described in lecture)
and Momentum.

*How does Adam work?* 1. It calculates an exponentially weighted average
of past gradients, and stores it in variables latexmath:[$v$] (before
bias correction) and latexmath:[$v^{corrected}$] (with bias correction).
2. It calculates an exponentially weighted average of the squares of the
past gradients, and stores it in variables latexmath:[$s$] (before bias
correction) and latexmath:[$s^{corrected}$] (with bias correction). 3.
It updates parameters in a direction based on combining information from
``1'' and ``2''.

The update rule is, for latexmath:[$l = 1, ..., L$]:

[latexmath]
++++
\[\begin{cases}
v_{dW^{[l]}} = \beta_1 v_{dW^{[l]}} + (1 - \beta_1) \frac{\partial \mathcal{J} }{ \partial W^{[l]} } \\
v^{corrected}_{dW^{[l]}} = \frac{v_{dW^{[l]}}}{1 - (\beta_1)^t} \\
s_{dW^{[l]}} = \beta_2 s_{dW^{[l]}} + (1 - \beta_2) (\frac{\partial \mathcal{J} }{\partial W^{[l]} })^2 \\
s^{corrected}_{dW^{[l]}} = \frac{s_{dW^{[l]}}}{1 - (\beta_2)^t} \\
W^{[l]} = W^{[l]} - \alpha \frac{v^{corrected}_{dW^{[l]}}}{\sqrt{s^{corrected}_{dW^{[l]}}} + \varepsilon}
\end{cases}\]
++++
where: - t counts the number of steps taken of Adam - L is the number of
layers - latexmath:[$\beta_1$] and latexmath:[$\beta_2$] are
hyperparameters that control the two exponentially weighted averages. -
latexmath:[$\alpha$] is the learning rate - latexmath:[$\varepsilon$] is
a very small number to avoid dividing by zero

As usual, all parameters are stored in the `parameters` dictionary

 +
### Exercise 5 - initialize_adam

Initialize the Adam variables latexmath:[$v, s$] which keep track of the
past information.

*Instruction*: The variables latexmath:[$v, s$] are python dictionaries
that need to be initialized with arrays of zeros. Their keys are the
same as for `grads`, that is: for latexmath:[$l = 1, ..., L$]:

[source,python]

### Exercise 6 - update_parameters_with_adam

Now, implement the parameters update with Adam. Recall the general
update rule is, for latexmath:[$l = 1, ..., L$]:

[latexmath]
++++
\[\begin{cases}
v_{dW^{[l]}} = \beta_1 v_{dW^{[l]}} + (1 - \beta_1) \frac{\partial \mathcal{J} }{ \partial W^{[l]} } \\
v^{corrected}_{dW^{[l]}} = \frac{v_{dW^{[l]}}}{1 - (\beta_1)^t} \\
s_{dW^{[l]}} = \beta_2 s_{dW^{[l]}} + (1 - \beta_2) (\frac{\partial \mathcal{J} }{\partial W^{[l]} })^2 \\
s^{corrected}_{dW^{[l]}} = \frac{s_{dW^{[l]}}}{1 - (\beta_2)^t} \\
W^{[l]} = W^{[l]} - \alpha \frac{v^{corrected}_{dW^{[l]}}}{\sqrt{s^{corrected}_{dW^{[l]}}} + \varepsilon}
\end{cases}\]
++++

*Note* that the iterator `l` starts at 1 in the `for` loop as the first
parameters are latexmath:[$W^{[1]}$] and latexmath:[$b^{[1]}$].

optimizers and observe the difference.

## 6 - Model with different Optimization algorithms

optimization methods. (The dataset is named ``moons'' because the data

Momentum usually helps, but given the small learning rate and the
simplistic dataset, its impact is almost negligible.

On the other hand, Adam clearly outperforms mini-batch gradient descent
and Momentum. If you run the model for more epochs on this simple
dataset, all three methods will lead to very good results. However,
you’ve seen that Adam converges a lot faster.

Some advantages of Adam include:

* Relatively low memory requirements (though higher than gradient
descent and gradient descent with momentum)
* Usually works well even with little tuning of hyperparameters (except
latexmath:[$\alpha$])

## 7 - Learning Rate Decay and Scheduling

Lastly, the learning rate is another hyperparameter that can help you
speed up learning.

During the first part of training, your model can get away with taking
large steps, but over time, using a fixed value for the learning rate
alpha can cause your model to get stuck in a wide oscillation that never
quite converges. But if you were to slowly reduce your learning rate
alpha over time, you could then take smaller, slower steps that bring
you closer to the minimum. This is the idea behind learning rate decay.

Learning rate decay can be achieved by using either adaptive methods or
pre-defined learning rate schedules.

Now, you’ll apply scheduled learning rate decay to a 3-layer neural
network in three different optimizer modes and see how each one differs,
as well as the effect of scheduling at different epochs.

This model is essentially the same as the one you used before, except in
this one you’ll be able to include learning rate decay. It includes two
new parameters, decay and decay_rate.

Notice that if you set the decay to occur at every iteration, the
learning rate goes to zero too quickly - even if you start with a higher
learning rate.

When you’re training for a few epoch this doesn’t cause a lot of
troubles, but when the number of epochs is large the optimization
algorithm will stop updating. One common fix to this issue is to decay
the learning rate every few steps. This is called fixed interval
scheduling.

### 7.2 - Fixed Interval Scheduling

You can help prevent the learning rate speeding to zero too quickly by
scheduling the exponential learning rate decay at a fixed time interval,
for example 1000. You can either number the intervals, or divide the
epoch by the time interval, which is the size of window with the
constant learning rate.

### Exercise 8 - schedule_lr_decay

Calculate the new learning rate using exponential weight decay with
fixed interval scheduling.

*Instructions*: Implement the learning rate scheduling such that it only
changes when the epochNum is a multiple of the timeInterval.

*Note:* The fraction in the denominator uses the floor operation.

\[\alpha = \frac{1}{1 + decayRate \times \lfloor\frac{epochNum}{timeInterval}\rfloor} \alpha_{0}\]

### 7.4 - Achieving similar performance with different methods

With Mini-batch GD or Mini-batch GD with Momentum, the accuracy is
significantly lower than Adam, but when learning rate decay is added on
top, either can achieve performance at a speed and accuracy score that’s
similar to Adam.

In the case of Adam, notice that the learning curve achieves a similar
accuracy but faster.
